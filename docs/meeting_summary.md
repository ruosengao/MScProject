# Meeting Summary
Please read this meeting summary alongside the [weekly agenda](weekly_agenda.md).

<!-- WEEK 1 -->
## Week 1 (11 - 17 May)

### Key Terms to Look up
The following concepts and theorems help to prepare the ground for understanding the objectives of the project.
> - Kolmogorov extension theorem,
> - infinitesimal generator (see Pazy's book on semigroups),
> - transition density are normal,
> - solution via expectation,
> - Feynman–Kac formula.

### Proposed Project Plan
> 1. Elliptic equations;
> 2. Analytic study of existence and uniqueness;
> 3. Connections with probability theory (via Feymann-Kac formula);
> 4. Methods for approximating solutions:
>    - Stochastic simulation method,
>    - Finite element method (if time permits);
> 5. Implementation.

<!-- WEEK 3 -->
## Week 3 (25 - 31 May)

### On Code Implementation
> - Perform a simulation study on Monte Carlo method;
> - Compute occupation time.

### Questions to be Prepared for the Oral Defense
> - Q: Why study this project?<br>
    Hints: physical phenomenon -- diffusion process, stochastic simulation helps when analytically intractable.
> - Q: How is this project related to statistics?<br>
    Hints: simulation, Monte Carlo method.

### Elena's Task
> - Send Ruosen Pablo's paper on variational method.
