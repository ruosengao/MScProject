# Meeting Summary
Please read this meeting summary alongside the [weekly agenda](weekly_agenda.md).

<!-- WEEK 1 -->
## Week 1 (11 May)

### Key Terms to Look up
The following concepts and theorems help to prepare the ground for understanding the objectives of the project.
> - Kolmogorov extension theorem,
> - infinitesimal generator (see Pazy's book on semigroups),
> - transition density are normal,
> - solution via expectation,
> - Feynman–Kac formula.

### Proposed Project Plan
> 1. Elliptic equations;
> 2. Analytic study of existence and uniqueness;
> 3. Connections with probability theory (via Feymann-Kac formula);
> 4. Methods for approximating solutions:
>    - Stochastic simulation method,
>    - Finite element method (if time permits);
> 5. Implementation.
